*Space for WHAM: a multi-region, multi-stock generalization of the Woods Hole Assessment Model with an application to black sea bass*

Timothy J. Miller, Kiersten L. Curti, Alexander C. Hansell

### Abstract

The Woods Hole Assessment Model is a general state-space age-structured assessment model that is used to assess and manage many stocks in the Northeast US. We first describe an extension of the model allowing any number of stocks (or stock components) and regions with movement among regions as well as seasonal variation in stock and fleet dynamics. Movement rates can be functions of time- and age-varying random effects and environmental covariates. We then illustrate the model by applying it to data for the northern and southern components of the Northeast United States black sea bass stock and evaluate alternative hypotheses of bottom temperature and time-varying random effects on recruitment and natural mortality. We show strong evidence for temperature effects on recruitment, primarily for the northern stock component, and no evidence for including random effects or temperature effects on age 1 natural mortality.
