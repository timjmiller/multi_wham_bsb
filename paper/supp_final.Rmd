## Deriving the prior distribution for movement parameters {-}

The Working Group fit a Stock Synthesis model [@methotwetzel13] that included tagging data with 2 seasons (6 months each) and 2 regions where a proportion $\mu^*_1$ of the northern component moves to the south in one season and some proportion  $\mu^*_{2\rightarrow 1}$ move back to the south in the second season [@nefsc23]. The seasonal movement matrices for each season are
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{\mu}^*_{1} = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
     1-\mu^*_{1\rightarrow 2} & \mu^*_{1\rightarrow 2} \\
     0 & 1 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{\mu}_{2} = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
     1 &  0 \\
     \mu^*_{2\rightarrow 1} & 1-\mu^*_{2\rightarrow 1} \\
  \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation*}

To obtain estimates of movement proportions for the monthly intervals in the WHAM model, the half-year movement matrices were converted to monthly movement matrices by taking the root $z_k$ of $\boldsymbol{\mu}^*_{k}$ which are defined by the number of months of movement for each season (5 and 4, respectively). The roots of the matrices are calculated using an eigen decomposition of the matrices
$$ \boldsymbol{\mu}_k =  \left(\boldsymbol{\mu}_k^*\right)^{z_k} = \mathbf{V}_k \mathbf{D}_k^{z_k} \mathbf{V}_k^{-1},$$
where $z_1 = 1/5$ for and $z_2 = 1/4$, and $\mathbf{V}_{k}$ and $\mathbf{D}_{k}$ are the matrix of eigenvectors (columnwise) and the diagonal matrix of corresponding eigenvalues of $\boldsymbol{\mu}^*_k$. The Working Group used a parametric bootstrap approach to determine an appropriate standard deviation for the prior distribution for the movement parameters. Stock Synthesis also estimates parameters on a transformed scale, but different from WHAM: 
$$\mu^*_{r\rightarrow r'} = \frac{1}{1 + 2e^{-x_{r\rightarrow r'}}}$$
The estimated parameters and standard errors from the Stock Synthesis model were $x_{1\rightarrow 2}=-1.44$ and $x_{2\rightarrow 1}=1.94$ and $SE(x_{1\rightarrow 2})) = 0.21$ and $SE(x_{2\rightarrow 1})) = 0.37$. The resulting in the estimated proportions were $\mu^*_{1\rightarrow 2}=0.11$ and $\mu^*_{2\rightarrow 1}=0.78$.

In WHAM, an additive logit transformation is used which is simply a logit transformation when there are only two regions: 
$$
\mu_{r\rightarrow r'} = \frac{1}{1+e^{-y_{r\rightarrow r'}}}.
$$
We simulated 1000 values from a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation defined by the parameter estimate and standard error $\tilde x_{{r\rightarrow r'},b} \sim N(x_{r\rightarrow r'}, SE(x_{r\rightarrow r'}))$ from the Stock Synthesis model. For each simulated value we constructed $\tilde {\boldsymbol{\mu}}^*_{{r\rightarrow r'},b}$, took the appropriate root and calculated inverse logit for $\tilde y_{{r\rightarrow r'},b}$. We calculated the mean and standard deviation of the values $y_{i,b}$. The mean values did not differ meaningfully from the transformation of the original estimates ($y_{1\rightarrow 2} = -3.79$ and $y_{2\rightarrow 1} = -0.79$) and the standard deviation was approximately 0.2 for both parameters.

## Bottom temperature anomalies {-}

The Working Group created bottom temperature observations from a high resolution ocean bottom temperature product by @dupontaviceetal23. The annual observations for each region are defined by the average over all spatial bottom temperature values for February and March by region and year. Similarly, the Working Group calculated standard errors from the standard deviation of all values in the region and the total number of values for a given year.  We created regional bottom temperature anomalies by subtracting means for each region across all years. 

## Diagnostics {-}

### Jitter fits for model $M_0$ {-}

WHAM by default completes three newton steps after the stats::nlminb minimization function completes to reduce the gradient at the minimized NLL. However, this generally has negligible effects on model estimates and the NLL. To reduce computation time, we did not complete these newton steps when performing jitter fits of the model. Without the Newton steps, the maximum (absolute) gradient sizes are generally less than 0.01 for models that converge satisfactorily.

The 50 jitter fits demonstrated that a local minimum was obtained for the original fit of model $M_0$ (Figure \ref{fig:jitter-M0}). One lower NLL was obtained with unacceptable gradients (No. 25), but a slightly lower NLL was found with a satisfactory gradient for 3 of the jitters (Nos. 9, 13, 29). However, one of the jitter fits (No. 9) did not provide a non-zero estimate of the variance parameter for one of the indices and the other two provided identical results and we refit model $M_0$ and all remaining models using the better parameter estimates as initial values. 

### Jitter fits for model $M_1$ {-}

The 50 jitter fits gave no evidence of a better minimization of the NLL. Three lower NLLs were obtained, but with unacceptably large gradients (Figure \ref{fig:jitter-M1}). The largest differences in parameter estimates for these three jitters were for numbers at age and selectivity random effects variance and correlation parameters.

### Self test for model $M_1$ {-}

Initial fits to simulated data from model $M_1$ showed estimation of the observation error standard deviation multiplier for the recreational catch-per angler indices in the north and south regions was unstable. Many of the fits to the simulated data produced implausible estimates at the 0 boundary for these parameters (very negative values on log-scale). However, across all fits including those with poor convergence, estimation of SSB and fishing mortality was reliable (Figure \ref{fig:self-test-fig}). We also fit analogous models with the multiplier parameters fixed at the true values, which did improve convergence, but larger bias was estimated for fishing mortality and SSB for the northern component.
